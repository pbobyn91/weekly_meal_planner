# Weekly Meal Planner

This is going to be a weekly meal planner. Ex:

Monday - Salmon

Tuesday - Pad Thai 

etc ....

This is going to use a flask API and a json file to store the data for each day. It will be able to use an in house IPv4 address (probably of the host it is running on.) You will be able to delete and update the weekly meals.
